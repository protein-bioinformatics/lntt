# LNTT #

The Lightweight Normalization and Testing Tool (LNTT) is a tool for easy normalizing, testing with statistical tests and plotting your data. Usually, your data is structured as a table with measurements as columns, entities (proteins, peptides, metabolites, lipids, what so ever) as rows and their according abundances in the cells.

## Installation ##

### Anaconda ##
We recommend to install a recent distribution of [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

### Python and Modules ###
The other way would be to install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and according several [modules](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) via the python prompt:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scipy
5. sklearn
6. statsmodels
7. urllib3

## Run LNTT ##

1. Either download LNTT on this page (left of the blue clone button above) or clone it, using the [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) repository system with its Windows integration as [TortoiseGIT](https://tortoisegit.org/download/).
2. Open a file browser and browse to the LNTT directory.
3. Right click on GUI.py and choose "Open with ...". Search for Python.exe (Either in C:\Python, or C:\Program files\Anaconda) and select it.
